                    What we’ve learned along the way is that Fortune Box is about so much more than that.
                    If you’ve ever felt overlooked by the beauty industry’s impossible, exclusive standards; if you’ve ever felt overwhelmed by the excess of choices, ingredients, routines, products; if you’ve ever felt like you just can’t keep up (which is nuts, because isn’t this stuff supposed to make you feel like your best self?) - we’re here for you.<br>

                    We’re here for anyone and everyone who enjoys beauty and grooming stuff, but who isn’t necessarily “obsessed” with it.<br>

                    We’re here for all those who identify as Beauty Casual.<br>

                    We’re a service for people who think of haircare and skincare and makeup as the extra cherry on top of a rich, busy life - not the ice cream, the bowl, and the spoon.<br>

                    We believe in products that work, are simple to use, and make you look and feel great. That feeling you get when your monthly box arrives-of joy, of discovery, of: a few seconds just for me-that’s what Fortune Box is about.</p><br>
